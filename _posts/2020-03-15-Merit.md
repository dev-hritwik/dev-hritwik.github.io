title: Merit does not exist
subtitle: An argument on why the idea of 'merit' in our society is based on flimsy foundations.  
---

Our society has tried to establish cultures and organizations which value merit. In fact, merit is often attributed as a virtue, people with merit must succeed and be better, people without merit should perish. However, on a piece by piece analysis, I had difficulty understanding what merit means and where does it stem from. Hence, I tried to decode and put my arguments on why we need a deeper look on what merit means and why, as it exists, merit is based on flimsy foundations.

Before we begin, let us define what merit means. I'll take the defition from [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/merit)
> Merit: something that deserves or justifies a reward or commendation; a commendable quality, act, etc.

Basically, the idea of merit is highly based on someone deserving something. The girl got JEE Advance rank 1 out of her own merit. Only someone with merit must be made captain of the team. In India, a tea-seller can become the Prime Minister based on their own merit. You get the idea.
